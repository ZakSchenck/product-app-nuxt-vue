## Tools used
* Vue
* Nuxt
* Sass
* Vuex
* Nuxt Router

## Description / Core Features
This is a frontend project that allows you to add items to cart, as well as view your current cart. It fetches a product API and allows you to filter what type of products you are viewing. The design and styling was all done by me. This site implements clean dynamic routing using Nuxt, as well as Vuex store features

## Future Features
I will be adding a buy page as well as a `successfully purchased` page during checkout
